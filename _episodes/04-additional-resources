Check the "Extras" tab at the top of the page for some additional resources. In particular, check out the Exercise Scripts link for some skeletons/templates for the scripts above to get you started. I'll also add "completed" exercise scripts a bit later on.

The "Examples Repository" link goes to a repository of analysis scripts/codes currently in use. You might want to refer to this as you get started on your own project if you are struggling to get off the ground. Or, it may just serve as an additional reference point.
