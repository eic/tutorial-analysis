  Commenting out for now until the final content of this part of the lesson is decided. Leaning towards not including the locating factory/algorithm as a core part of the tutorial. - SJDK 29/03/24

What we generally call the simulation output are root trees generated by the reconstruction software, [EICrecon](https://github.com/eic/EICrecon/tree/main). The branches which appear in the output trees and their content are determined by which EICrecon factories and algorithms are run.

- Note, root 6.30.02 which is now used by eic-shell has some... backwards compatibility issues. If try to open file produced with root 6.30.02 in an older version of root, you're going to be in for a bad time. 
- If you're trying to open interactive windows such as a TBrowser via x-forwarding, it's likely to be very slow. You may wish to just copy the file to your local machine and open it there. 
  - The webviewer may also be quicker (although it's less usable and you will struggle to do more than just browsing the tree) - https://eic.phy.anl.gov/geoviewer/

## EICrecon Output Tree Structure

The output tree contains various branches appropriate for the individual detector subsystems. For example, the calorimeter subsystems will have branches for reconstructed hits and clusters. In addition to individual subsystem information, there are also branches for reconstructed quantities (e.g. reconstructed particles, inclusive kinematics, and jets) which may combine information from several subsystems. There are also branches encoding relationships between different reconstructed quantities as well as reconstructed and truth quantities. 

> Exercise
> - Stream a simulation output tree from within root (see previous lesson) and browse the structure by calling `new TBrowser()`
> - Take some time to explore the branches of the tree. What information is included for various subsystems? What are some of the reconstructed quantities?
> - Try plotting some basic quantities. Plot the cluster energy of the negative endcap ECal - do you see the peak from the scattered electron?

Commenting out for now. I think associations and relations will be useful, but the other two seem to be more "advanced use cases" to me. Diving into the factories/algorithms seems to me more like something you would do if you were debugging an algorithm you had created, rather than just analysing existing output. - SJDK 29/03/24
